# Genetic_Swarm
This is a genetic algorithm describing the behaviour of individuals to reach a targetposition in a 2D space.
A random set of movements is selected at the initial stage of the simulation.
For each individual the fitness (distance to target position) is calculated.
The fittest (50%) of individual will survive and will reproduce offspring.
Two parents will reproduce 2 children by crossing genetic codes.
A random (5%) mutation is added.
Visual output is given to easily observe the behaviour of the population over time.
